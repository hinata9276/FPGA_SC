Step to reproduce the MATLAB simulation

1) extract the zip files:

   -> multiwaitbar.m is for showing progress (to lessen the programmer's anxiety)

   -> schedule_MNISTnet2_trimmedOpClk stored the MNIST CNN information in the SC domain

   -> skip the gz files as it will be automatically unzipped in the simulation script

2) open the SC_MNIST_Sim.mlx
