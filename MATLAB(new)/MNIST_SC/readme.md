Steps to reproduce the MATLAB simulation

1) Extract the zip files:

   -> multiwaitbar.m is for showing progress (to lessen the programmer's anxiety)

   -> schedule_MNISTnet2_trimmedOpClk stored the MNIST CNN information in the SC domain

   -> skip the gz files as they will be automatically unzipped in the simulation script

2) Open the SC_MNIST_Sim.mlx. You may need to change the associated directories before running the live script.

3) All the SC functions are contained in the Appendix section in the live script. 

Expected results:
Binary CNN accuracy = 0.9836
Stochastic Computing CNN accuracy =
